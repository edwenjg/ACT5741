Automakers often want their concept cars to generate buzz at an auto show, and by putting the new ET Preview right in the middle of its enormous booth at Auto Shanghai 2019, NIO certainly managed to get people's attention. The elegant white sedan shares more than a few design touches with the Tesla Model S (the door handles and rear wheel arches, for example), while also keeping some of the NIO design language in the front fascia and glossy sunroof on top.

The problem is that the visuals were not backed up by much in the way of information. NIO says the ET Preview is "the first glimpse of its all new Sedan product line" and that it "represents NIO's exploration of an all new car body, whose sleek new contours combine elegant proportions with power and beauty through a minimalistic design." Beyond that, there's bupkis in the press release and no one at the booth would tell me any details. So, well, here's another picture.

Aside from the ET Preview, NIO built a temporary version of its NIO House customer centers to display all of its vehicle and things like its high-performance EV platform in Shanghai. The platform uses a NCM811 nickel-cobalt-manganese battery pack and two permanent magnet motors (one on each axle) to give cars using the platform a range of up to 317 miles, using Europe's NEDC test system.

Other NIO announcements at the show include an expansion of its "One Click For Power" service, which the company said has now been used over 93,000 times. While NIO Owners can subscribe to a "Worry-free Power Plan" that allows 15 uses of "One Click For Power" a month, the new program extension means that any EV driver in China can now use a "NIO Charging" mini app within the popular WeChat service to get their EV recharged by NIO's team for 280 yuan (about $42 US) per call. Clicking for the service will call up a NIO Power van to some and recharge your EV wherever it is.

There aren't many Auto Show booths where taking a picture in panoramic mode makes sense, but @NIOGlobal's set-up here at #AutoShanghai is an exception. Also, a new electric vehicle concept called the ET Preview. pic.twitter.com/9dYU5H9ASW

I have been writing about electric vehicles, hybrids, and hydrogen since 2006. My articles and reviews have appeared on most of the big green car blogs, Automotive News, The New York Times, Car Talk, and other places. I believe the shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles is important and interesting not just for the auto industry, but for the world as a whole. Throw in the more recent shift to autonomous vehicles, and there are more interesting changes happening now than most people can wrap their heads around. And let's not forget that EVs can be tremendously fun. If I've learned anything in my years on this beat, it's that once you've driven electric, you don't want to go back. Read Less
